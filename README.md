# spring-boot-thymeleaf
_**Spring Boot with Thymeleaf. Spring Security with registration and login_**

**Register User to get login access.**

To make this app run first of all run the insert_roles.sql file 
in your database. This will give user the admin role. For
now only admin role is given but it can later be upgraded with 
user role who will have limited access.

Run the db_structure.sql file in your database
which will make all the required tables or else
just run the app tables will be generated automatically.
